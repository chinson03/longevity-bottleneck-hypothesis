# longevity-bottleneck-hypothesis
Code and data for testing the Longevity Bottleneck Hypothesis w/ comparative genomics

Ongoing project, requiring multi-step analysis and final scripts. Current TODO:

Script to download data.

 - Now relocated to /data, spread between scripts. Will need to be converted to singular script with all download links

Ancestral trait loss analysis.

 - Regenerative traits are available for amphibians/reptiles, liimted data for other clades; maybe look at gene pathways for mammals/birds

dn/ds analysis for selective pressures in mesozoic stem lineages

 - Not started, will follow time-scaled phylogenetic tree

Expression analysis

 - Possibly included under ancestral trait loss analysis
